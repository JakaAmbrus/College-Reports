# Electrical Machine Modelling
This subject is meant to upgrade our knowledge of Electrical machines after the subject Electrical Machines in the semester prior.
I have uploaded some of my laboratory reports where it showcases my works and reaserch using and other electronics provided by my uni MatLab. 
I realise the work is in slovenian but the code and process should give you an idea of the competences I have aquired.
