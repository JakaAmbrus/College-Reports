# Electrical Power Networks and Devices
I have uploaded some of my laboratory reports where it showcases my works and reaserch using and other electronics provided by my uni MatLab. 
I realise the work is in slovenian but the code and process should give you an idea of the competences I have aquired.
## Prerequisits:

The prerequisite for the course is the enrolment in the third year. The prerequisite for the oral exam is a positive assessment of tutorials report.
## Content (Syllabus outline):

Development of electric power networks and general division of power networks. Mechanical parameters of overhead power lines, construction of lines, and electrical parameters of overhead lines. Composition of high voltage power cables, construction of power cables, impedances of single-core and three-core cables. Loading criteria of power networks. Electrical parameters of two winding and three winding transformers, synchronous generators and asynchronous machines. Types of power substations with different implementations of switchyards. High voltage switching technology â€“ circuit breakers and other switching devices. Classical power factor correction devices, passive filters and reactors. Modern compensation devices with power electronics modules. Distributed power sources and active distribution networks.

## Objectives and competences:

The student will acquire the knowledge of main elements and devices of electrical power networks and the basic knowledge of mathematical modelling and parameters of electrical power elements used in power systems analysis.

## Intended learning outcomes:

Knowledge and understanding:

The student will become familiar with the functions of main power network elements and will be able to independently model and determine the parameters of the power system elements and devices.

Application:

Gathered knowledge forms the basis for mathematical modeling of power system elements used in the system analysis.

Reflection:

The student will understand the relationship between the structure of elements and devices and their electrical parameters and will also understand the use of symmetrical components.

Transferable skills:

Mathematical descriptions of power network elements are transferable in simulation programs.
