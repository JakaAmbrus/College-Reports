# Electrical Machines
I have uploaded some of my laboratory reports where it showcases my works and reaserch using and other electronics provided by my uni MatLab. 
I realise the work is in slovenian but the code and process should give you an idea of the competences I have aquired.

## Prerequisits:

Subscription in second year of university study.
## Content (Syllabus outline):

A common base of electric machines: the nominal data types and operation of electrical machines, magnetic field, induced voltage, electromagnetic torque, losses and efficiency, heating of electrical machines, electromagnetic compatibility. Addressing basic electrical machines: transformers, autotransformatorji, synchronous machines, induction machines and commutator machines. Presentation and discussion of modern electrical machines and their use at electricity generation using renewable energy, automation of industrial processes, transport vehicles - hybrid vehicles, robotics, superconducting systems, power tools and micro-electromechanical systems.

## Objectives and competences:

The aim of this course is to gain theoretical knowledge needed to understand the basic concepts of electrical machines and principles of operation of various types of electrical machines.
Knowledge of the basic electric machines circuit models and input-output characteristics of electrical machines.
Understanding of basic tests in the field of electrical engineering. Provide guidance for understanding the operational problems of electrical machines.
## Intended learning outcomes:

The student will understand the basics of electromechanical energy conversion and basic concepts of torque and mechanical equilibrium.
Principles of operation of electric generators and motors. Understand the basic characteristics of various types of electrical machines.
Faced with the problems of construction and design of electrical machines.
Understand the simple tests of electromechanical devices and the field of use for individual type of electrical machine.
## Learning and teaching methods:

Lectures, tutorials and laboratory work.
Laboratory exercises are with heightened risk (high voltage, rotating parts, ...).
The course consists of 45 hours of lectures 15 hours of tutorial and 30 hours of laboratory exercises with heightened risk.
